Hi, I am libcommbase. I am a collection of libraries to centralize common functions that can be shared across multiple conversational AI assistant projects. I operate offline and can be implemented with AI (ML/DS) and programming languages. Likewise, I am usually distributed with Commbase, a module bundler that combines files for my usage. Commbase comes with several sample projects that demonstrate how to use it to build conversational AI assistants and "distributed AIs" or "multi-agent systems" (M A S ) implemented as a set of separate processes or applications running on a single computer, droid, or smart appliance
