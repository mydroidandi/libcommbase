Hi, I am libcommbase. I am a collection of libraries to centralize common functions that can be shared across multiple conversational Artificial Inteligence powered assistant projects. I can be implemented with A I ( M L / D S ) and programming languages. Likewise, I am usually distributed with Commbase, a module and library bundler and flexible development framework.
